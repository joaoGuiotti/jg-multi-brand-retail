- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit-plan`.
- Token TTL (1 hour) and rate-limit window (5 min) are documented as defaults in Assumptions;
  can be adjusted by the team during planning without requiring a spec revision.
- US3 (Resend) is P2 and can be deferred to a second iteration if needed.
